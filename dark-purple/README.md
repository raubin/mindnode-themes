## Installation

To install the theme, [simply download](https://github.com/raubin/mindnode-themes/raw/master/dark-purple/dark-purple.mindnodetheme) the `dark-purple.mindnodetheme` file and open it.
It will be automatically added to your list of available themes.

## Fonts

The screenshot shows this theme using [Source Code Pro for Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/SourceCodePro). Mindnode themes don't seem automatically inherit selected fonts, so you will need to install the font and then select it in Mindnode to apply it to your theme.
